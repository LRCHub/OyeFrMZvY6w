[00:17.73] Do you remember
[00:20.73] When you and I were young?
[00:25.63] We always stared each other down
[00:28.52] Till we were numb
[00:32.81] There in the madness
[00:35.90] Us against the world
[00:40.48] And every heartbeat felt like
[00:43.32] This is what we deserve
[01:02.53] With every heartbeat
[01:10.43] With every heartbeat
[01:14.19] With every heartbeat
[01:17.25] With every heartbeat
[01:25.43] With every heartbeat
[01:29.22] We were dancing to the sound
[01:32.38] Of a broken heart
[01:36.78] I remember running in the dark
[01:43.62] We were dancing to the sound
[01:47.11] Of a broken heart
[01:51.46] There in the madness
[01:54.11] Us against the world
[01:58.62] And every heartbeat felt like
[02:01.55] This is what we deserve
[02:06.82] We were dancing to the sound
[02:09.63] Of a broken heart
[02:13.74] We were dancing to the sound
[02:16.93] Of a broken heart
[02:24.27] With every heartbeat
[02:32.61] With every heartbeat
[02:35.74] With every heartbeat
[02:40.08] With every heartbeat
[02:47.35] With every heartbeat
[02:51.04] We were dancing to the sound
[02:54.03] Of a broken heart
[03:02.65] We were dancing to the sound
[03:05.50] Of a broken heart
[03:10.01] We were dancing to the sound
[03:12.79] Of a broken heart
[03:17.29] We were dancing to the sound
[03:20.16] Of a broken heart
[03:24.70] We were dancing to the sound
[03:27.69] Of a broken heart
